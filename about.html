            Graduated in Digital Design, I have years of experience in the area,
            where I had the opportunity to create visual identities, logos,
            artwork for websites, printed materials, marketing emails, video
            editing and pieces for social media.
          </p>

          <p class="about__bio-text">
            After this long journey, I started to get interested in programming,
            specifically the frontend development of creative websites.

              Had the opportunity to create visual identities for events such as

              Collaborated in the development of an interactive prototype for a
              new website. Furthermore, during this period, we managed to
              achieve great results in our main media, and I also had the
              privilege of becoming certified in the main instrument, the MBTI®.
              As a result, I was able to develop myself a lot through the
              self-knowledge that this experience provided.

              Had the opportunity to work on the design of a prototype for a new

              Collaborated in the development of interactive applications for

              Joined as an intern and developed myself a lot. Applied many
              things learned at university such as: Logo creation, creative
              process for developing visual identity, various pieces for
              internal marketing, video editing, material standards, etc. I grew
              up very quickly in the company, and when I saw myself, I was
              already working full-time. I had several promotions in a short
              period, being constantly recognized by the team.

            <p class="jobs__description">
              During this period, I helped Fellipelli a lot to consolidate the
              brand in the market. We carried out extremely segmented
              advertising campaigns, with attractive marketing emails promoting
              each course in a unique way. We have also worked on this in our
              website, through banners, which were constantly updated and very
              modern, great newsletters and through social media.
